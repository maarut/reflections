What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a repository is initialised, all that happens is that the metadata
structures are created. They are not populated with any data until the first
commit. This needs to happen first, so that git knows that this is a directory
that the user intends to track the revision history of.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The staging area is a place to hold changes right before a commit is made. The
working directory is an up to the second reflection on what you are working on
whether the files or changes have been added to version control or not. The
staging area is valuable because it allows the user to double check that they
are committing only the changes that they need to before actually committing
to the repository.
