When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few instance where a remote repository would be useful. One of
those times is when you are working on a project as part of a team. The main
repository could live remotely, and whilst you are working on a particular
feature, you could clone the repository and work on the feature remotely. When
you are done implementing the feature, the branch on which the feature lives
can be pushed to the remote repository.

Further to the above, you would also make a remote repository if you wanted to
make your code public.

Another time when you must work with a remote repository, is if you are cloning
and working on a repository on which you cannot commit. This can happen on an
open source project for example. If you require a particular feature that the
current contributors do not want to implement, you would clone the repository,
and add your feature. You would also essentially create a fork of the project,
but you could always request the maintainer pull your changes back to the main
project.
