When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few instance where a remote repository would be useful. One of
those times is when you are working on a project as part of a team. The main
repository could live remotely, and whilst you are working on a particular
feature, you could clone the repository and work on the feature remotely. When
you are done implementing the feature, the branch on which the feature lives
can be pushed to the remote repository.

Further to the above, you would also make a remote repository if you wanted to
make your code public.

Another time when you must work with a remote repository, is if you are cloning
and working on a repository on which you cannot commit. This can happen on an
open source project for example. If you require a particular feature that the
current contributors do not want to implement, you would clone the repository,
and add your feature. You would also essentially create a fork of the project,
but you could always request the maintainer pull your changes back to the main
project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pulling changes manually ensures that the user is able to have control over the
state of their local repository. It will avoid any unwanted conflicts from
occuring.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A fork is a Github term for a remote clone of a repository. This is simply a
clone that is not owned by you on Github.

A clone is a copy of another repository, whether remote or local.

A branch is a git term for code that is diverging from the mainline code. For
example, if a developer is creating a feature not yet ready for prime time,
they can create a branch from the main code and develop their feature on the
branch. This ensures that the code on the branch remains isolated from the main
code.
